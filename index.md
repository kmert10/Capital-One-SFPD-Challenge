This challenge by Capital One requires a deep analysis of the public data from the San Francisco Fire Department that contains dispatch 
information for emergency calls, with call time, location, and dispatch. Using this dataset, I have generated custom graphs to understand
key insights from the dataset. From investigating the dataset, these calls were made between 01/13/2018 - 01/24/2018.
## Optimizations & Analysis:
***Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.***
1. The first trend I found interesting in the data set was the units sent to certain calls in certain areas. In order to analyze this trend, I plotted sent unit types for calls in every region/location in San Fransisco. This revealed that two unit types,"Investigation" and "Support", had only specific regions that were called in the given region. These two plots are shown below:
![Investigation Regions](https://github.com/kmert10/Capital-One-SFPD-Challenge/blob/master/Website%20Graphs%20Images/cool%20thing%20part%201%20a.PNG)
![Support Regions](https://github.com/kmert10/Capital-One-SFPD-Challenge/blob/master/Website%20Graphs%20Images/cool%20thing%20part%201%20b.PNG/)
This finding shows that these types of units can be located near these regions, which can improve responce time and effectiveness.
